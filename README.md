# Regent Street Commercial Assets Analysis

This is a brief analysis of energy efficiency on Regent Street and surrounding area! This repository contains a brief analysis aimed at an intital identification of potential risks and opportunities associated with the commercial assets on Regent Street in London. The geospatial analysis is focused on estimating energy savings potential and trends of energy savings bands. 

## Files

- `regent_street_analysis.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main analysis. It covers data exploration, calculations, visualizations, and insights derived from the data.
- Large files: Due to their size, some files may need to be unzipped after download. These files are necessary for the analysis but couldn't be directly uploaded to GitHub due to size restrictions.

## Requirements

To replicate and run the analysis in the `regent_street_analysis.ipynb` notebook, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

## Motive for Analysis

The main objectives of this analysis were to:
- Estimate the energy savings potential of commercial assets on Regent Street.
- Compare Regent Street's energy efficiency with neighboring areas in London using an interactive map.
- Identify potential energy savings on Regent Street.
- Identify key assets on Regent Street for both risk and opportunity assessment.

## Challenges

A significant challenge in this analysis was the absence of energy cost and potential cost data for commercial assets. As a result, estimates were derived based on standardized efficiency performance and savings potential derived from domestic assets in the same neighborhood. This estimation relied on the current energy ratings profile and emissions savings profile.
